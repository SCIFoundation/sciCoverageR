This vignette details how to obtain and amend the [Equity Tool](https://www.equitytool.org) data and perform the calculation to obtain the equity score and equity quintile for each household, based on the questions posed during a coverage evaluation survey.

## Obtaining data

The questions and answers to establish the equity scores vary from country to country as well as over time. The country specific details need to be downloaded from the [Equity Tool website]( https://www.equitytool.org). This requires navigating to the country site and requesting the country file by filling out the form for *Other platforms*. `Figure 1` shows the website with the form for Côte d’Ivoire.

<br>

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Figure 1 - Equity Tool Website", fig.topcaption=TRUE, out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/et_website_civ.png")
```

<br>
Once filled out, you should quickly receive an email to the address provided with the Equity Tool information contained in an attached Excel file. This file contains four sheets. Relevant to our purposes is the last sheet named “*Other software*”. This sheet contains the questions to be posed to the household respondent, the possible answers as well as the associated scores. `Figure 2` shows the *Other software* sheet for Côte d’Ivoire.

<br>

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Figure 2 - Equity Tool country Excel file", fig.topcaption=TRUE, out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/Original_equity_tool_output_2.png")
```

<br>
Note that, at the cleaning and analysing stage, this document will already have been downloaded and the questions and answers coded into the survey forms used by the enumerators to collect the responses.

Scrolling down a bit further on the *Other software* sheet, you will find a vector of four values used to categorise equity scores into quintiles. `Figure 3` shows this vector (next to the red arrow), referred to henceforth as the *vector of quintiles* for the case of Côte d’Ivoire.

<br>

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Figure 3 - Equity Tool country Excel file with vector of quintiles", fig.topcaption=TRUE, out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/Original_equity_tool_vector_of_quintiles.png")
```

<br>
For some countries, the equity tool will differentiate between national scores, urban scores, and rural scores. Which option to use (national, urban, or rural) will depend on the country and survey. The example followed here is based on the national scores and the national vector of quintiles.

## Amending data

The data, as it is on the *Other software* sheet from Equity Tool, cannot be used directly as the questions are full sentences and do not have a variable name assigned. In addition, the language of the questions and answers may vary from one country to another.

You need to simplify these codes into a table of seven column and as many rows as there are questions (11 in the case of Côte d’Ivoire). The first column contains the names of the variable associated to each question, as defined in the survey forms. The second column contains the possible answer to the questions, while the third column holds the associated scores. The fourth and fifth columns have the same information for the second possible answer; the sixth and seventh columns contain the answers and scores for the third possible answer – whenever a third option was present.

`Figure 4` shows the stripped-down question, answer, and score structure for Côte d’Ivoire, based on the information shown in `Figure 2`.

<br>

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Figure 4 - Stripped-down version of the Equity Tool file", fig.topcaption=TRUE, out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/adapted_equity_tool_simple.png")
```

<br>
Note that the order of the column (question, answer, score) needs to be followed for the calculation to work. The name of the columns (here: `question`, `op1`, `op1_s`, …) is irrelevant (i.e., names could be: `super`, `duper`, `varnames`, …)

## Calculating the equity output

To calculate the equity scores and compute the equity quintiles we need three elements: the data containing the answers from the household respondents on the Equity Tool questions, the data containing the answer codes and associated scores and the vector of quintiles.

The previous step showed how to amend the Equity Tool information and save it. Once the stripped-down version of the Excel file has been stored, it needs to be read in.

<br>

```{r}
# equity_answers <- readxl::read_xlsx( [::Pathfile::] )
```

<br>

This package contains an example of hte file shown in `Figure 4`. If we call on it we can see the data frame contains the same information.

<br>

```{r}
data(eq_answers, package = "sciCoverageR")
head(eq_answers)
```

<br>

This package further contains an example data frame for household answers from a coverage survey using the [WHO Coverage Evaluation Survey methodology](https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/329376/9789241516464-eng.pdf). We can see, it contains 2261 rows and 38 columns. The answers to the Equity Tool questions are stored in columns 9:19.

<br>

```{r}
data(hh, package = "sciCoverageR")
dim(hh)
names(hh)
```

<br>

Let us extract those columns into a separate data frame called `eq`. Additionally, for reasons that will become apparent soon, let us save `eq_2`, which by mistake also contains the 20th column.

<br>

```{r}
eq <- hh[, 9:19]
eq_2 <- hh[, 9:20]
```

<br>

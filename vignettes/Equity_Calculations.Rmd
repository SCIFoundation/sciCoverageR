This vignette details how to obtain and amend the [Equity Tool](https://www.equitytool.org) data and perform the calculation to obtain the equity score and equity quintile for each household, based on the questions posed during a coverage evaluation survey.

## Obtaining data

The questions and answers to establish the equity scores vary from country to country as well as over time. The country specific details need to be downloaded from the [Equity Tool website]( https://www.equitytool.org). This requires navigating to the country site and requesting the country file by filling out the form for *Other platforms*. `Figure 1` shows the website with the form for Côte d’Ivoire.

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Figure 1 - Equity Tool Website", fig.topcaption=TRUE, out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/et_website_civ.png")
```

Once filled out, you should quickly receive an email to the address provided with the Equity Tool information contained in an attached Excel file. This file contains four sheets. Relevant to our purposes is the last sheet named “*Other software*”. This sheet contains the questions to be posed to the household respondent, the possible answers as well as the associated scores. `Figure 2` shows the *Other software* sheet for Côte d’Ivoire.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Figure 2 - Equity Tool country Excel file", fig.topcaption=TRUE, out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/Original_equity_tool output_2.png")
```

Note that, at the cleaning and analysing stage, this document will already have been downloaded and the questions and answers coded into the survey forms used by the enumerators to collect the responses.

Scrolling down a bit further on the *Other software* sheet, you will find a vector of four values used to categorise equity scores into quintiles. `Figure 3` shows this vector (next to the red arrow), referred to henceforth as the *vector of quintiles* for the case of Côte d’Ivoire.


```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Figure 3 - Equity Tool country Excel file with vector of quintiles", fig.topcaption=TRUE, out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/Original_equity_tool_vector_of_quintiles.png")
```

For some countries, the equity tool will differentiate between national scores, urban scores, and rural scores. Which option to use (national, urban, or rural) will depend on the country and survey. The example followed here is based on the national scores and the national vector of quintiles.

## Amending data

The data, as it is on the *Other software* sheet from Equity Tool, cannot be used directly as the questions are full sentences and do not have a variable name assigned. In addition, the language of the questions and answers may vary from one country to another.

You need to simplify these codes into a table of seven column and as many rows as there are questions (11 in the case of Côte d’Ivoire). The first column contains the names of the variable associated to each question, as defined in the survey forms. The second column contains the possible answer to the questions, while the third column holds the associated scores. The fourth and fifth columns have the same information for the second possible answer; the sixth and seventh columns contain the answers and scores for the third possible answer – whenever a third option was present.

`Figure 4` shows the stripped-down question, answer, and score structure for Côte d’Ivoire, based on the information shown in `Figure 2`.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Figure 4 - Stripped-down version of the Equity Tool file", fig.topcaption=TRUE, out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/adapted_equity_tool_simple.png")
```

Note that the order of the column (question, answer, score) needs to be followed for the calculation to work. The name of the columns (here: `question`, `op1`, `op1_s`, …) is irrelevant (i.e., names could be: `super`, `duper`, `varnames`, …)
